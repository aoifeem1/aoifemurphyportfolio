        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Teaching has always been a career I have interest in paired with a keen love for mathematics along with a
            desire to delve more into the world of tech I chose this course.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for various aspects of technology including cybersecurity and the growth of artificial
            intelegence in recent years.
            The idea of having a system that is able to respond to you is mind blowing.
            During school placement I also got the opportunity to observe various robotics clubs within the school and
            would love to explore this further following graduation.</p>
        <p>As a person I have many career ambitions hoping to integrate my technology skills into the classroom while
            also hoping to complete further studies on additonal educational needs,
            ensuring that all my stduents can reach their full potential. </p>

        <hr>
        <p>This website is just a basis for what I hope will be a growing portfolio.
            Currently this page reflects some aspects of my life but I feel the addition of a contact
            section would allow me to communciate with more web developers and further my networking.
        </p>
        <p>If I were to gain more web development skills I would like to implement more interatcive elements
            in to my page such as custom animaitons to enhance user experience and responsive design improvements
            for tablet and phone users.
        </P>
